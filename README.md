# Slot Games Developer - Test assignment

## Description:
You need to create a simple slot game with only one reel and three visible symbols on it.

### Conditions of winning: 

- If there are 2 symbols of the same kind on the reel you win the double
amount of your bet. If there are 3 symbols of a kind on the reel you win triple the amount of your
bet.

- The user starts with 100 dollars.

- Price of spin is 1 dollar.

- If the user has no money, the spin button should be disabled.

- Normal spinning time is 3 seconds.

- Quick stop can be made by the click on spin button while reels are spinning, but all 3 previous
symbols should go out of the screen.

- Win and balance should be on the screen as text fields.

- Spinning animation should be smooth.

## Reel used in the game:

SYM1,SYM5,SYM1,SYM3,SYM4,SYM3,SYM2,SYM4,SYM3,SYM6,SYM3,SYM1,SYM6,SY
M1,SYM2,SYM1,SYM2,SYM2,SYM2,SYM1,SYM2,SYM1,SYM4,SYM1,SYM3,SYM6,SYM1,
SYM3,SYM2,SYM5,SYM3,SYM1,SYM2,SYM2,SYM2,SYM1,SYM4,SYM1,SYM4,SYM1,SY
M3,SYM2,SYM4,SYM4,SYM5,SYM2,SYM3,SYM1,SYM1,SYM1,SYM4,SYM5,SYM2,SYM2,
SYM2,SYM1,SYM5,SYM6,SYM1,SYM3,SYM4,SYM2,SYM5,SYM2,SYM1,SYM5,SYM1,SY
M2,SYM1,SYM1,SYM1,SYM4,SYM4,SYM3,SYM3,SYM5,SYM5,SYM4,SYM2,SYM5,SYM2,
SYM1,SYM3,SYM2,SYM3,SYM1,SYM4,SYM3,SYM4,SYM2,SYM3,SYM4,SYM1,SYM1,SY
M1,SYM2,SYM6,SYM3,SYM2,SYM3,SYM1,SYM5

As an example you can look at any other slot game with reels mechanics.

Requirements: Code should be structured and readable. Use any way of code organization as
long as you consider it well-written. Use PIXI as a rendering engine. Use JavaScript or
TypeScript. DO NOT USE AI to generate code.

Best test assignment would have both: well written code and gameplay.
